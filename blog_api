Python

# migrations/0001_initial.py

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    initial = True

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name='Post',
            fields=[
                ('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),
                ('title', models.CharField(max_length=200)),
                ('content', models.TextField()),
                # ... other fields
            ],
        ),
    ]
